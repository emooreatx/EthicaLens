      "question": "A luxury sports-car is traveling north at 30km/h over a roadbridge, 250m long, which runs over a river that is flowing at 5km/h eastward. The wind is blowing at 1km/h westward, slow enough not to bother the pedestrians snapping photos of the car from both sides of the roadbridge as the car passes. A glove was stored in the trunk of the car, but slips out of a hole and drops out when the car is half-way over the bridge. Assume the car continues in the same direction at the same speed, and the wind and river continue to move as stated. 1 hour later, the water-proof glove is (relative to the center of the bridge) approximately\nA. 4km eastward\nB. <1 km northward\nC. >30km away north-westerly\nD. 30 km northward\nE. >30 km away north-easterly.\nF. 5 km+ eastward\n",
      "expected_answer": "B",
      "output": {
        "answer": "To solve the problem, we need to break down the motion of the glove after it falls from the car.\n\n1. **Understanding the Scenario**:\n   - The car is moving north at **30 km/h**.\n   - The river flows east at **5 km/h**.\n   - The wind blows west at **1 km/h**.\n   - The glove drops from the car when it is halfway across a **250 m** bridge.\n\n2. **Height and Time of Fall**:\n   - When the glove drops, it will fall from a height of about **1 meter** (the height of the car above the bald man's head if we assume the glove drops halfway over the bridge).\n   - Using the equation for free fall: \\( h = \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\), we can solve for \\( t \\):\n     - \\( 1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9.81 \\cdot t^2 \\)\n     - This simplifies to \\( t^2 = \\frac{2}{9.81} \\)\n     - Calculating \\( t \\) gives approximately \\( t \\approx 0.45 \\) seconds.\n\n3. **Displacement During Time of Fall**:\n   - During this fall time \\( t \\) (about 0.45 seconds), the car continues moving northward:\n     - Distance traveled by the car in time \\( t \\): \n       - \\( d = speed \\times time = 30 \\text{ km/h} \\times \\frac{0.45}{3600} \\)\n       - Convert to meters: \\( d \\approx 0.375 \\text{ meters} \\).\n   - The river continues to carry the glove eastward at **5 km/h** for the complete time the glove is falling.\n     - Distance traveled eastward by the river in time \\( t \\): \n       - \\( 5 \\text{ km/h} \\times \\frac{0.45}{3600} \\approx 0.000625 \\text{ km} \\) or about **1.875 meters** east.\n\n4. **Wind Influence**:\n   - The wind is blowing in the opposite direction (west) at **1 km/h**, but given that it affects the glove for a very short duration (~0.45 seconds), its impact is minimal compared to the river's current.\n\n5. **Calculating Final Position**:\n   - After falling, the total displacement of the glove considering both the river and its own northward movement while the car proceeds is:\n     - North: Essentially negligible since it only dropped momentarily.\n     - East: The glove is influenced mainly by the river which moves it significantly eastward.\n  \n   Therefore, after 1 hour, which is excessively longer than the glove's drop, the glove will be carried mainly by the river\u2019s flow.  \n   It will be about **5 km eastward** from the center of the bridge, primarily due to the river's speed, and the glove essentially moves with that current.\n\nThe best answer is:\n\n**F. 5 km+ eastward.**",
