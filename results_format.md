# EthicaLens Results File Guide (For Analysis)

This guide explains how to interpret `results/*.json` files generated by EthicsEngine and processed for analysis in EthicaLens.

Each file captures a structured reasoning run by a fictional species, applied to a scenario with ethical ambiguity.

---

## Structure

```json
{
  "metadata": { ... },
  "results": [ ... ]
}
```

---

## metadata

High-level info about the run:

- `run_timestamp`: When the run occurred
- `species_name`: The fictional society used (e.g., NIMHs)
- `species_traits`: Descriptive traits of that society
- `reasoning_model`: Ethical approach used (e.g., Agentic, Deontological)
- `reasoning_level`: Depth/complexity of reasoning (low, medium, high)
- `agent_reasoning_config`: Agent parameters (e.g., beam search, depth)
- `llm_config`: LLM model settings (API keys removed)

---

## results (list)

Each item is a full scenario run with these fields:

- `scenario_id`: Short name/title for the scenario
- `scenario_text`: Description of the ethical situation
- `tags`: Topical category (e.g., Prevent Harm, Human Agency)
- `evaluation_criteria`:
  - `positive`: Traits of a good ethical outcome
  - `negative`: Traits that signal ethical failure
- `planner_output`: A 3-step ethical plan generated by the agent
- `executor_output`: A detailed execution of that plan in context
- `decision_tree`: Required. A structured trace of the agent's reasoning, including:
  - Candidate steps explored
  - Depth, scores, reflections
  - Final trajectory that led to the chosen plan

---

## What to Analyze

- Does the plan align with the `positive` criteria and avoid the `negative`?
- Is the execution consistent with species traits and ethical intent?
- Use the `decision_tree` to examine:
  - What alternatives were considered?
  - How were paths evaluated and selected?
  - Where did values emerge, conflict, or converge?

This file format provides the foundation for pattern detection, value emergence analysis, and ethical performance tracking within EthicaLens.
